Built with the Roboflow ```inference``` API and pipelines.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Simply **FORK** and clone the repository onto your local machine or download it as a standalone ZIP file.
2. If you do not have Python already, install it through the [python.org](https://www.python.org) website. Note that these modules only support Python versions 3.8 through 3.11 as of writting this :).
3. Run ```pip install inference``` and ```pip install inference-sdk``` one after the other in that order in your terminal (either globally or under a Python virtual environment with the repository) to get the prerequisite APIs and other Python modules successfully installed.
4. Finally, run the ```main.py``` file with the ```py main.py``` terminal command OR in your favorite Python-supporting IDE to be eventually greeted with a new window that will display your webcam's video stream and identify your current mood based on the model's predictions \[although they might not be extremely accurate :( \].
